 * suspends when the app leaves the foreground.

 * accuracy, speedMph, heading, maxSpeedMph }) fires immediately and then on
 * every fix or error, where start/end are { lat, lng } and route is the full
 * [{ lat, lng }, ...] path.
 *
 * speedMph and heading are the current fix's `coords.speed` (converted to
 * mph) and `coords.heading` (degrees clockwise from true north), for the
 * real-time driving-safety layer (the drive-timer speed readout, the
 * accel-event speed gate). speedMph is passed through a plausibility gate
 * first (see IMPLAUSIBLE_SPEED_MPH / MAX_ACCEL_MPH_PER_S); maxSpeedMph is the
 * highest gated reading so far this drive, for recording a drive's top speed.
 * Any of the three is null when the device doesn't report speed/heading, when
 * heading is undefined because the vehicle is stationary, or on a fix too
 * coarse to use — trust them only while status is 'tracking', as with
 * `accuracy`.
 *
 * status is one of:
 *   'unsupported' — no geolocation API in this browser
 *   'waiting'     — watching, no usable fix yet
 *   'tracking'    — recording fixes
 *   'imprecise'   — fixes arriving but too coarse to use (see
 *                   MAX_ACCURACY_METERS); `accuracy` carries the last value
 *   'denied'      — permission refused
 *   'unavailable' — position could not be determined
 *
 * The caller is expected to surface anything other than 'tracking'. Reporting
 * status is the point: these states previously failed silently, so a drive
 * could run to completion having recorded nothing, and the first sign of it
 * was a saved log with no distance and no map.
