/**
 * Escaping helpers for the outbound email templates.
 *
 * Names in this app are free text typed by a user (a student's first/last
 * name) or taken from a self-chosen auth profile (the owner's displayName),
 * and both get interpolated into HTML email bodies that are delivered to
 * *other* people from this project's own sending address. Without escaping,
 * anyone who can create an account can put arbitrary markup — a link, a
 * hidden block, a whole fake message — into mail that arrives looking like
 * it came from Student Driver Log. Every interpolation of user-controlled
 * text into an email's HTML must go through escapeHtml().
