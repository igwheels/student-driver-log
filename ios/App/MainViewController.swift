import Capacitor

/**
 * The app's Capacitor bridge view controller, wired up in
 * Base.lproj/Main.storyboard in place of Capacitor's own
 * CAPBridgeViewController.
 *
 * It exists for exactly one reason: to register RebootCheckPlugin.
 * Capacitor 8 auto-registers only the classes named in the generated
 * App/capacitor.config.json `packageClassList`, and `cap sync` rebuilds
 * that list purely from the Capacitor plugins installed under
 * node_modules — an app-local plugin can never appear in it, no matter
 * that its source file is in the App target. With no registration the
 * bridge never injects a PluginHeader for "RebootCheck", and
 * @capacitor/core's registerPlugin() proxy rejects every call with "not
 * implemented" without ever reaching native. That is what made
 * getDeviceBootTime() return null on device and left the reboot half of
 * the biometric session policy inert.
 *
 * capacitorDidLoad() is the hook for this: the bridge exists by then, and
 * the web view has not been loaded yet, so the header is injected before
 * any app JS runs.
